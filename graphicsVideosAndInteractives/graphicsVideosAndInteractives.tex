We've seen basic ways to include JPGs, PNGs, and PDFs using
\verb!\includegraphics!. However, this is not the preferred way to include
graphics. Moreover, there are considerations for positioning of the graphics.

\section{Positioning graphics}

In \LaTeX\ it is common to write images in the \verb!figure! environment. We
choose not to use this because \verb!figure! `floats' the images for `optimal'
page layout. We are not concerned with page layout. When working online, the
page is essentially infinite in length. Moreover, the \textit{consumers} of the
content we create are \textit{students}. Students are also unconcerned with
awkward page layout. Students prefer to see the image exactly when it is
mentioned. With this said, we suggest wrapping all images in either a
\verb!center! environment or an (Ximera-specific) \verb!image! environment.
The environment \verb!image! centers and automatically scales the contents.  If
an author finds themselves printing to various page-sizes, \verb!image! might
be preferred. Moreover, \verb!image! can be redefined globally to act
identically to \verb!center!, but \verb!center! cannot be redefined.

If you use \verb!center!, you would write something like:
\begin{verbatim}
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=5cm]{missionPatch.jpg}
\end{center}
\end{verbatim}
If you use \verb!image!, you would write something like:
\begin{verbatim}
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=5cm]{missionPatch.jpg}
\end{center}
\end{verbatim}

The disadvantage of using \verb!\includegraphics! is that you need to handle
the paths to the images in some way. In the past we've added the files in the
repository to the graphics path. However, we now suggest you use a global
graphics path. The repository
\begin{center}
  \url{https://github.com/XimeraProject/ximeraNewProject}
\end{center}
Comes with the file \verb!preamble.tex! with
\begin{verbatim}
\graphicspath{	   %% setup a global graphics path
  {./}		   %% look in the same-level directory
    {./graphics/}	   %% look in graphics
    {../graphics/}	   %% look up one directory, then in graphics
  %{../../graphics/} %% look up two directories, then in graphics
}
\end{verbatim}
This means that any required \verb!*.jpg!, \verb!*.png!, and \verb!*.pdf! can
be found, assuming your file isn't nested too deep.
Moreover, we've set up the \verb!.gitignore! to \text{not ignore} \verb!*.jpg!,
\verb!*.png!, and \verb!*.pdf! when they are placed in the \verb!graphics!
directory. Finally, while this is currently the \textit{easiest} method for
adding graphics in Ximera, it might be better if all graphics were placed at
the level of the source file, and then a soft link (using the terminal) could be made to the
\verb!graphics! directory. The advantage here being that if someone wants to borrow your material, everything they need is in the same folder. 

With this said, TikZ is the preferred method for graphics because code, found
in the Ximera \LaTeX\ file, generates the image. No need to worry about
graphics paths.

\section{TikZ is the preferred method for graphics}

The preferred way to include graphics is with TikZ.
\begin{image}
  \begin{tikzpicture}
    \begin{axis}[
        xmin=-6.4,
        xmax=6.4,
        ymin=-1.2,
        ymax=1.2,
        axis lines=center,
        xlabel=$x$,
        ylabel=$y$,
        every axis y label/.style={at=(current axis.above
            origin),anchor=south},
        every axis x label/.style={at=(current axis.right of
            origin),anchor=west},
      ]
      \addplot [ultra thick, blue, smooth] {sin(deg(x))};
    \end{axis}
  \end{tikzpicture}
\end{image}

\begin{verbatim}
\begin{image}
\begin{tikzpicture}
  \begin{axis}[
  xmin=-6.4,
  xmax=6.4,
  ymin=-1.2,
  ymax=1.2,
  axis lines=center,
  xlabel=$x$,
  ylabel=$y$,
  every axis y label/.style=
    {at=(current axis.above origin),anchor=south},
  every axis x label/.style=
    {at=(current axis.right of origin),anchor=west},
  ]
\addplot [ultra thick, blue, smooth] {sin(deg(x))};
\end{axis}
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{image}
\end{verbatim}

\section{The graph command}

The easiest way to include an interactive graph is to use the
\verb|\graph| command. Unfortunately, the \verb|\graph| command
doesn't draw a graph in the PDF, rather, it states (in words) that a
graph is produced.
\begin{verbatim}
\graph{x^2,x^3}                     %% just x^2 and x^3
\graph{x^2 
\left\{ 1 \leq x \leq 10 \right\}}   %% restricted domain
\graph{\sin(x) \left\{x<0\right\}, 
2x \left\{ x>=0 \right\} }          %% piecewise
\graph{r=\theta} %% polar 
\end{verbatim}

\[
  \graph{x^2,x^3}
\]
There are a number of options for the \verb|\graph| command:

\paragraph{Change viewing window}
\[
  \graph[xmin=-5,xmax=5,ymin=-5,ymax=5]{y=x^2}
\]

\paragraph{Restricting domain}
\[
  \graph{x^2 \left\{ 1 \leq x \leq 10 \right\} }
\]
\paragraph{Graphing a piecewise function}

\begin{verbatim}
\[
\graph{ \sin(x)\left\{x<0\right\}, 2x\left\{ x>=0 \right\} }
\]
\end{verbatim}

\paragraph{Optional arguments for \texttt{\textbackslash graph}}

\begin{description}
  \item[\tt\bfseries xmin, ymin, xmax, ymax] These set the
    size of the viewing window with
    \verb|\graph[xmin=-5,xmax=5,ymin=-5,ymax=5]{y=x^2}|.
  \item[\tt\bfseries panel] Determines if the panel is shown with
    \verb|\graph[panel]{y=x^2}|.
  \item[\tt\bfseries xAxisLabel, yAxisLabel] Gives the axes labels with
    \verb|\graph[xAxisLabel="time", yAxisLabel="distance"]{y=x^2}|.
  \item[\tt\bfseries hideXAxis, hideYAxis] Hides the axes with
    \verb|\graph[hideXAxis=true, hideYAxis=true]{x^2}|.
  \item[\tt\bfseries hideXAxisNumbers=true, hideYAxisNumbers=true] Hides the
    tick marks on
    the axes with
    \verb|\graph[hideXAxisNumbers=true, hideYAxisNumbers=true]{y=x^2}|.
  \item[\tt\bfseries polar] Shows polar grid lines with
    \verb|\graph[polar]{y=x^2}|.
\end{description}

\[
  \graph{x^2 \left\{ 1 \leq x \leq 10 \right\}}
  \graph{ \sin(x)\left\{x<0\right\}, 2x\left\{ x>=0 \right\} }
\]
\section{Videos}

We can embed YouTube Videos with something like
\begin{verbatim}
\begin{center}
\youtube{FvgF95i0_lw}
\end{center}
\end{verbatim}
which would embed the video into the page, like this:
\begin{center}
  \youtube{FvgF95i0_lw}
\end{center}

\begin{warning}
  YouTube videos count toward the completion of the activity. As such,
  currently, students must watch the \textbf{entire} video to earn full credit.
\end{warning}

\section{Desmos, Desmos 3D, and GeoGebra}

If you require further features from
\link[Desmos]{https://www.desmos.com/}, you can sign up for an account
and include your worksheets like this:
\begin{verbatim}
\begin{center}
\desmos{zwywds7med}{800}{600}
\end{center}
\end{verbatim}
which renders as:
\begin{center}
  \desmos{zwywds7med}{800}{600}
\end{center}

\providecommand{\desmosThreeD}[3]{}   % HACK: should be defined ???

The syntax for Desmos 3D is similar:
\begin{verbatim}
\begin{center}
\desmosThreeD{bb4exrhrl3}{800}{600}
\end{center}
\end{verbatim}
Seen here:
\begin{center}
  \desmosThreeD{bb4exrhrl3}{800}{600}
\end{center}

You can also use \link[GeoGebra]{https://www.geogebra.org/}. Embed the
widget using the syntax \verb|\geogebra{ID}{width}{height}|, where ID
is the widget ID and width and height are the dimensions (in pixels)
you want the embedded widget to have.
\begin{verbatim}
\begin{center}
\geogebra{XC3FXUdJ}{800}{600}
\end{center}
\end{verbatim}
\begin{center}
  \geogebra{XC3FXUdJ}{800}{600}%%https://www.geogebra.org/m/XC3FXUdJ
\end{center}

While we cannot get data from these sorts of interactives directly, the clever
author can ask questions that \textbf{use} the interactive to find a solution.
