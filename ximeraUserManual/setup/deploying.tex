Finally to deploy:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Make sure all source files are committed and pushed to the repository. A quick 
\begin{verbatim}
git add -u && git commit -m "this is my change" && git push
\end{verbatim}
may help. Also, you can check your personal GitHub page to ensure files are in the repository.
\item Press \textit{Bake}.
\item Press \textit{Serve}.
\end{enumerate}


As hard as we try to support the philosophy that \textit{if it compiles in
    \LaTeX, it compiles online}, it isn't always true. If you find that \textit{Bake} cannot compile a file, you can try the following. Start by running the following:
\begin{verbatim}
./scripts/xmlatex -i bash
\end{verbatim}
in a terminal window, note \textbf{you must be at the top level of your repository}.
After that, an interactive \verb!bash! shell should start. Then run the following in turn and see if they give any good information:
\begin{verbatim}
pdflatex FILE-NAME.tex
xake -v compile FILE-NAME.tex
more FILE-NAME.tex.log
\end{verbatim}
If  you find a file that does not compile, you can try to compile the file directly while 
slowly moving \verb!\end{document}! down through the document. By starting at the top, the file should compile, and then you should be able to locate the exact location of the bug.
