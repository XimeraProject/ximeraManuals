In this section we walk through the basics of \verb!git!.

% When you use GitHub, you are writing code in public. You don't want randos to
% be able to change your code, and they cannot.  But that same protection might make it 
% difficult for you to develop. So we need to set up a bit of security, called
% SSH, so that you can authenticate but others cannot.
% Once we are finished with that, we will give you some basic \texttt{git}
% commands.

% \paragraph{Setting up SSH} GitHub requires some security. One way to do this is
% to add an SSH key. To check to see if this is already done, open Visual Studio
% Code, open a (WSL) terminal with \verb!Ctrl-~! and enter
% \begin{verbatim}
% git remote -v
% \end{verbatim}
% if it responds with something like: If it responds with
% \verb!git@github.com:STUFF! then you
% are good and can skip this. If not, and it responds with
% \verb!https://github.com/STUFF! the you
% need to change to SSH, read on!

% First we must create the key. There are instructions on \link[GitHub's pages]%
% {https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent}
% Once the key is created, go to your personal GitHub page, like
% \verb!https://github.com/bartsnapp! and:
% \begin{enumerate}
%       \item  Click on \textit{Settings}, it lives in the circular picture in
%             upper right hand corner.
%       \item Click on \textit{SSH and GPG keys}, it's on the left.
%       \item Click the green button \textit{New SSH key}
%       \item Name it \textit{My Ximera Key}.
%       \item Paste in your Key.
% \end{enumerate}
% Now when you clone a repository, you will use the SSH option.  To convert a
% repository from the HTTPS option to SSH,
% \begin{verbatim}
% git remote set-url origin git@github.com:STUFF
% \end{verbatim}
% You should be ready to go at this point.

\paragraph{Basic commands} of \verb!git! are good to know.
If you are working with a collaborator, you should always start your work off with
\begin{verbatim}
git pull
\end{verbatim}
typed in terminal. This will retrieve any updates your collaborators have made. 

First of all if you make a new file, you need to \textit{add} it to the
repository. Suppose the name of your new file was MY-NEW-FILE.tex. You should
type:

\begin{verbatim}
git add MY-NEW-FILE.tex
git commit -m "I've add MY-NEW-FILE.tex"
git push
\end{verbatim}
The \verb!add! includes the file in the files that \verb!git! tracks. The
\verb!commit! says, ``hey I made a change that I want to keep track of.'' The
\verb!push! says ``I want to share this with others.''

If, on the other hand, you want to push changes made to files you already have,
type use \verb!git add -u! and it will add all updated files. 
\begin{verbatim}
git add -u
git commit -m "I updated some files"
git push
\end{verbatim}
You can combine these commands into one with \verb!&&!:
\begin{verbatim}
git add -u && git commit -m "this is my change" && git push
\end{verbatim}

Finally, you don't have to add the \verb!-m! to \verb!commit!. However, if you
choose to take this path, we strongly recommend running:
\begin{verbatim}
git config --global core.editor "nano"
\end{verbatim}
for an easy to use text editor that is not \verb!vi!. If for some chance you
accidently enter \verb!vi! by typing \verb!git commit!, you'll know you are in
\verb!vi! because the terminal won't work and the left hand side is filled with
\verb!~!,
\begin{center}
    press \verb!Esc! \quad then press \verb!:!\quad then press \verb!q! \quad
    then
    press \verb#!# \quad then press \verb!Enter!
\end{center}
Then run the code above so that it never happens again.

\paragraph{Adding images and PDFs with \texttt{git}}

We typically add \verb!*.jpg!, \verb!*.png! and \verb!*.pdf! to the
\verb!.gitignore! file. However this makes it a little tricky to add graphics.
In this case you \textit{force} the add with \verb!-f!:
\begin{verbatim}
git add -f SOME-GRAPHICS.jpg
\end{verbatim}
