    We introduce you to \texttt{git}, and help you make changes on your own.

\maketitle
Once you've deployed our content in a GitHub codespace, you'll surely want to
change it and  make it your own.

    Within codespace, you are running VS Code, a
    full-fledged text editor. You can make changes directly there. Our files
    are on
    the left, and are revealed by the ``pages'' icon.
    Here, I've opened the folder \verb!aFirstFolder!, and then the document
    \verb!aFirstActivity.tex!. I made a change in the middle of the screen.

    At this point, you may push ``SERVE'' and see the results of your change;
    however, \textbf{these changes were made only in your temporary codespace},
    a
    virtual
    computer, lost in the cloud. To make these changes to your actual GitHub
    repository, you need to ``sync'' them back.

    Remember Git is like a magical notebook that remembers every change you
    make to your
    project. It helps you go back in time if something breaks and lets you
    share
    your work with others. For this reason, it makes you do a little ``dance''
    to ensure good code hygiene.

    \paragraph{Step 1: Staging Files (The ``+'' Button)}

    You start by clicking on the icon that looks like a poorly drawn ``Y'' with
    lines and circles on the left. Then you click on a $+$ for every file you
    want
    to send to your repository.  When you click the little \textbf{``+''} next
    to a
    file, you're saying,
    \begin{quote}
        \emph{``Hey Git, this file is ready to be saved!''}
    \end{quote}

    This adds the file to a special list called the \textbf{staging area}. Only
    files in this list will be saved in the next step.

    \paragraph{Step 2: Committing Changes (Saving Your Work)}

    After staging your files, you
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item \textbf{type a message} directly above the green ``Commit''
              button.
        \item Click ``Commit.''
    \end{enumerate}
    This tells Git:
    \begin{quote}
        \emph{``Save these changes forever, and here's a note about what I
            did.''}
    \end{quote}
    Git takes a snapshot of the staged files and saves them with your message.
    If you would ever need to undo your work from this point, this message will
    help guide your future-self.

\paragraph{Step 3: Syncing with GitHub (Sending Your Work Online)}
When you click \textbf{``Commit and Sync''}, you're telling Git:
\begin{quote}
    \emph{``Send my saved changes to the big Git notebook on GitHub.''}
\end{quote}
Git takes your saved changes and sends them to your \textbf{remote
    repository}
(the one on GitHub). At the same time, it checks if there are any new
changes from your teammates and brings them back to you. At this point,
VS Code in your codespace will ask you if you periodically want to sync.
You can click ``Yes.''

To check that everything worked correctly, go to

\end{center}
Above we see my repository, and we see that my change was indeed made.


\paragraph{The Git Workflow}

For a new author, this can be overwhelming. Here are the steps once again.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Stage:} Use the ``+'' button to pick what you want to
          stage for commit (save).
\begin{verbatim}
git add FILE-NAME-1 FILE-NAME-2  # You can list multiple files or
git add -u                       # Add all modified files 
\end{verbatim}
    \item \textbf{Commit:} Write a message and click ``commit'' to save
          your
          changes.
\begin{verbatim}
git commit -m 'A GOOD MESSAGE'
\end{verbatim}
    \item \textbf{Sync:} Send your changes to GitHub and get updates from
          your
          team.
\begin{verbatim}
git pull && git push
\end{verbatim}
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{Checking Your Work}

After syncing, go to:
\begin{center}
    \url{https://github.com/YOUR-GIT-USER-NAME/YOUR-REPO-NAME}
\end{center}
You should see your changes there!
